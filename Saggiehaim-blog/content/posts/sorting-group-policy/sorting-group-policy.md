So, this is the first post for 2019! Happy new year!Today I want to talk about a painful topic, the Group Policy.
It‚Äôs almost the same in every company. it‚Äôs historical, contain a lot of Group Policy and if you ever try to touch it, half of the systems stop working.

Last week I saw a post from my good friend Omer a Microsoft PFE, as he talked about [Common Mistakes in Active Directory and Domain Services](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/meamcs/2018/12/31/most-common-mistakes-in-active-directory-and-domain-services-part-1/).
He points out that Removing ‚ÄúAuthenticated Users‚Äù from the GPO Object Security Filtering is a bad thing.
he also provided a PowerShell script to find GPO‚Äôs without ‚ÄúAuthenticated Users‚Äù permissions.

After running his GPO script, I saw that there few GPO‚Äôs that needed to sort.
It gave me the motivation to analyze my entire environment, as a result, I created a few scripts.

## The Target

Firstly, before I start, I‚Äôm writing down what I need to look for:

- Disabled GPO‚Äôs
- Empty GPO‚Äôs
- Unlinked GPO‚Äôs
- Missing permissions GPO‚Äôs (Based on Omer Script)

I wrote all tests together in one script, but later decided to divide them to functions, so I can run each test individually and in the future create a complete Group Policy Report utilizing those functions.
Therefore let‚Äôs deep dive on each test.

## Disabled GPO‚Äôs

In this test, we will look for GPO‚Äôs with User, Computer or both setting disabled.

### the issue

Technically, there is no issue with GPO with disabled settings.
But if both of them is disabled, then its unused GPO.
We probably don‚Äôt need them. If only User or Computer disabled, then it's a ‚Äúred flag‚Äù and we need to make sure we are not ‚Äúlosing‚Äù configuration.
Maybe we can merge the settings with another GPO?

### The Function

This will check if there are any settings disabled and return the GPO's.

```PowerShell
function Get-GPODisabled {
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param (
    )
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy module"
        Import-Module GroupPolicy -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "GroupPolicy Module not found. Make sure RSAT (Remote Server Admin Tools) is installed"
        exit
    }
    $DisabledGPO = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy Policies"  
        $GPOs = Get-GPO -All  
        Write-Verbose -Message "Found '$($GPOs.Count)' policies to check"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "Can't Load GPO's Please make sure you have connection to the Domain Controllers"
        exit
    }
    ForEach ($gpo  in $GPOs) { 
        Write-Verbose -Message "Checking '$($gpo.DisplayName)' status"
        switch ($gpo.GpoStatus) {
            "ComputerSettingsDisabled" {$DisabledGPO += "in '$($gpo.DisplayName)' the Computer Settings Disabled"}
            "UserSettingsDisabled" {$DisabledGPO += "in '$($gpo.DisplayName)' the User Settings Disabled"}
            "AllSettingsDisabled" {$DisabledGPO += "in '$($gpo.DisplayName)' All Settings Disabled"}
        }
    }
    if (($DisabledGPO).Count -ne 0) {
        Write-Host "The Following GPO's have settings disabled:"
        return $DisabledGPO
    }
    else {
        return "No GPO's with setting disabled Found"
    }
        
}
```

## Empty GPO‚Äôs

In this test, we will look for empty GPO‚Äôs, that means that the GPO has no setting configured on it.

### The issue

Empty GPO‚Äôs are useless and just adding more overhead.
We don‚Äôt need them in our environment.

### The Function

This function will check if there is GPO with the User or Computers settings empty.
one common mistake people do, is they check the ‚ÄúUser version‚Äù and ‚ÄúComputer version‚Äù, while it true that a new GPO start with version 0 on both of them and changed in each modification.
but if you take an old GPO and remove all settings, the version won‚Äôt reset to 0, and you will miss those GPO‚Äôs!

![Empty GPO with computer version 4.](../images/GPO.png  "Example of GPO settings")

```PowerShell
function Get-GPOEmpty {
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param (
    )
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy module"
        Import-Module GroupPolicy -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "GroupPolicy Module not found. Make sure RSAT (Remote Server Admin Tools) is installed"
        exit
    }
    $EmptyGPO = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy Policies"  
        $GPOs = Get-GPO -All  
        Write-Verbose -Message "Found '$($GPOs.Count)' policies to check"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "Can't Load GPO's Please make sure you have connection to the Domain Controllers"
        exit
    }
    ForEach ($gpo  in $GPOs) { 
        Write-Verbose -Message "Checking '$($gpo.DisplayName)' status"
        &#91;xml]$GPOXMLReport = $gpo | Get-GPOReport -ReportType xml
        if ($null -eq $GPOXMLReport.gpo.User.ExtensionData -and $null -eq $GPOXMLReport.gpo.Computer.ExtensionData) {
            $EmptyGPO += $gpo
        }
    }
    if (($EmptyGPO).Count -ne 0) {
        Write-Host "The Following GPO's are empty:"
        return $EmptyGPO.DisplayName
    }
    else {
        return "No Empty GPO's Found"
    }
}
```

## Unlinked GPO‚Äôs

In this test, we will have the most results, as it's the most common case.
Unlinked GPO‚Äôs are GPO‚Äôs that not linked to any domain, site or OU.

### The issue

Unlinked GPO‚Äôs are not an ‚Äúissue‚Äù but most of the time, they are useless overhead to manage and track.
In my company, there was GPO‚Äôs from 2008. I guess we won‚Äôt use it anymore üòí

### The function

```PowerShell
function Get-GPOUnlinked {
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param ()
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy module"
        Import-Module GroupPolicy -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "GroupPolicy Module not found. Make sure RSAT (Remote Server Admin Tools) is installed"
        exit
    }
    $UnlinkedGPO = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy Policies"  
        $GPOs = Get-GPO -All  
        Write-Verbose -Message "Found '$($GPOs.Count)' policies to check"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "Can't Load GPO's Please make sure you have connection to the Domain Controllers"
        exit
    }
    ForEach ($gpo  in $GPOs) { 
        Write-Verbose -Message "Checking '$($gpo.DisplayName)' link"
        &#91;xml]$GPOXMLReport = $gpo | Get-GPOReport -ReportType xml
        if ($null -eq $GPOXMLReport.GPO.LinksTo) { 
            $UnlinkedGPO += $gpo
        }
    }
    if (($UnlinkedGPO).Count -ne 0) {
        return $UnlinkedGPO.DisplayName
    }
    else {
        return Write-Host "No Unlinked GPO found"
    }
}
```

## Missing Permissions

Here we will test to see if there are GPO‚Äôs with missing Read permissions to the ‚ÄúAuthenticated Users‚Äù or ‚ÄúDomain Computers‚Äù groups.

### The Issue

This test is based on Omer post I shared before, so I recommend you give it a read if you haven‚Äôt yet.
he explains it better than me üòÉ
### The Function

```PowerShell
function Get-GPOMissingPermissions {
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param ()
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy module"
        Import-Module GroupPolicy -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "GroupPolicy Module not found. Make sure RSAT (Remote Server Admin Tools) is installed"
        exit
    }
    $MissingPermissionsGPOArray = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
    try {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Importing GroupPolicy Policies"  
        $GPOs = Get-GPO -All  
        Write-Verbose -Message "Found '$($GPOs.Count)' policies to check"
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error -Message "Can't Load GPO's Please make sure you have connection to the Domain Controllers"
        exit
    }
    ForEach ($gpo  in $GPOs) { 
        Write-Verbose -Message "Checking '$($gpo.DisplayName)' status"
        If ($GPO.User.Enabled) {
            $GPOPermissionForAuthUsers = Get-GPPermission -Guid $GPO.Id -All | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Trustee | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Authenticated Users"}
            $GPOPermissionForDomainComputers = Get-GPPermission -Guid $GPO.Id -All | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Trustee | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Domain Computers"}
            If (!$GPOPermissionForAuthUsers -and !$GPOPermissionForDomainComputers) {
                $MissingPermissionsGPOArray += $gpo
            }
        }
    }
    if (($MissingPermissionsGPOArray).Count -ne 0) {
        Write-Host "The following GPO's do not grant any permissions to the 'Authenticated Users' Or 'Domain Computers' Group"
        return $MissingPermissionsGPOArray.DisplayName
    }
    else {
        return &#91;string]"No GPO's with missing permissions to the 'Authenticated Users' or 'Domain Computers' groups found "
    }
}
```

## Doing it Safe

Before you make any changes, I highly recommend you to backup any GPO before you change or delete.
If you hear people scream and shout outside, just restore the GPO.

### Backup GPO's

While you can easily backup GPO‚Äôs over the GUI, we love PowerShell more.
so we will do it with PowerShell.

To backup all GPO‚Äôs or specific ones, just run the following cmdlet:

```PowerShell
## Backup All GPO's
Backup-Gpo -All -Path "Location"
 
## Backup specific GPO
Backup-Gpo -Name "GPO NAME" -Path "Location" -Comment "Comment" 
```

### Restore-GPO

If we want to restore deleted or changed GPO, we can use the following cmdlet:

```PowerShell
## Restore All GPO's
Restore-GPO -All -Domain "Domain Name" -Path "Backups Location"
 
## Restore specific GPO
Restore-GPO -Name "GPO NAME" -Path "Backup Location
```

Restore-GPO only support restoring GPO‚Äôs of the **same** domain!

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we learned what we need to search.
We saw the functions that will help us find the GPO‚Äôs.
And we learned to backup and restore GPO‚Äôs.
It‚Äôs time to sort the group policy mess! in the future, I hope to release the full GPO environment report, so stay tuned and good luck!
