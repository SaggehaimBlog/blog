Hey Guys!
It‚Äôs been a long time since my last post, as I been busy with work trips.
But now I‚Äôm back! And I want to share with you my experience with PowerShell and SharePoint Online.
To be honest, I never worked with SharePoint before.
I got a request from the SharePoint team to update a list weekly from a CSV report that HR provides (Weekly employees birthdays, nothing exciting).

![ ](../images/2porh9.jpg  "You have no power here meme")

First thing to do? Jump head-on to google and understand what my tools are.
I found this task to be really easy, but it took me a while to find what I needed.
Every post I sew online talked about the SharePoint Online module, and some complex queries and scripts...
But I share the greatest skill of IT Admin, I‚Äôm lazy...
and it seems hell lot of work for such a simple task...
So, I move on and keep searching.

After reading Microsoft Docs I notice something called PnP, Jackpot!
PnP stands for Patterns and Practices, and it contains a library of PowerShell commands that allows you to perform complex provisioning and artifact management actions towards SharePoint.

So, I first looked for my ‚Äúlists‚Äù cmdlets and found everything I need to complete my tasks.
I won‚Äôt write much about installing and using this module as Microsoft Docs provides a great explanation, you can visit the page [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps).

So, to further explain my task, I wrote my steps:

1. Connect to the SharePoint Online
2. Import the CSV
3. Empty the list
4. Update the list from the CSV

## Connect to the SharePoint Online

To connect your SharePoint online using the PnP is really easy:

```PowerShell
$userCredential = Get-Credential -Message "Type the password."
$WebUrl = "https://SaggieHaim.sharepoint.com/sites/Portal"
Connect-PnPOnline ‚ÄìUrl $WebUrl ‚ÄìCredentials $userCredential
```

## Import the CSV

After we connected to the SharePoint, it‚Äôs pretty easy to import the CSV:

```PowerShell
$employeesBirthday = Import-Csv -Path "D:\Tasks\Update Sharepoint Events list\WeeklyBirthdays.CSV"
```

## Empty the list

Now to empty the list, we can simply use the Get-PnPListItem and Remove-PnPListItem:

```PowerShell
Get-PnPListItem -List "$listName" | foreach { Remove-PnPListItem -List "$listName" -Identity $_.Id -Force}
```

## Update the list from the CSV

So, we passed the halfway mark, but this step gave me a headache!
For some reason I kept getting this message when I tried to update to list:

> add-pnplistItem : The specified user could not be found‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like, WHAT?? it's a string! not a username!

I decided to try one manually just to understand the fields in the list, and then I notice, that EventAuthor field request a username!
The report I get from the old HR system contains the full name, and luckily for me, it‚Äôs enough.
But, unlucky for me‚Ä¶ I get Last Name First Name, and SharePoint wants First Name Last Name ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so off we go:

We can use the add-PnPListItem cmdlet for each employee in the list:

```PowerShell
    foreach ($employee in $employeesBirthday) 
            {
            ## Replacing first and last names
            $EventAuthor = $employee.name.Split(" ")[1] + " " + $employee.name.Split(" ")[0]
            $expire = $person.Expires
                Add-PnPListItem -List "LumenisGreetingsList" -Values @{
                                "Title" = "IMF" ; 
                                "EventDay" = "$employee.EventDay"; 
                                "EventMonth" = "$employee.EventMonth"; 
                                "EventType" = "birthday";
                                "Role" = "$employee.Role"; 
                                "EventAuthor" = $EventAuthor; 
                                "Expires" = "$employee.expire"
                                }
            }
```

Now that everything is working, tested and ready I can build my first SharePoint and PowerShell automation script üòÅ
I hope my hard learning will make it easier for your ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù with SharePoint Online!
