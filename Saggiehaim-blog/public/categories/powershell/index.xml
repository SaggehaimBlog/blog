      <description>PowerShell is the Automator&amp;rsquo;s best friend. I automate everything with PowerShell, and you can also. When it comes to Azure, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I created a resource in the Portal. I either use PowerShell or IaC to provision resources or modify them.&#xA;In this post, you will learn how to set up a session with Azure to start to interact with Azure Resources.&#xA;Prerequisites Before we start, there are few global prerequisites that you need to meet:</description>

      <title>Install Powershell 7 on Wsl and Ubuntu</title>

      <description>With PowerShell 7, we get the best PowerShell edition, most importantly, it‚Äôs cross-platform! While last time we installed the latest PowerShell 7 on a container, sometimes we don‚Äôt want just a plain environment with PowerShell, sometimes we want a to add other tools, change system configurations or use different Linux Distros.&#xA;That is why we use WSL.&#xA;What is WSL? WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux is a feature that lets us run full Linux distributions on top of our Windows OS without the overhead of running virtualization tools.</description>

      <title>Background Jobs Start Threadjob vs Start Job</title>
      <link>//localhost:8080/posts/background-jobs-start-threadjob-vs-start-job/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:8080/posts/background-jobs-start-threadjob-vs-start-job/</guid>
      <description>PowerShell can run background jobs with the Start-Job cmdlet. Most of the cmdlet also have -AsJob switch to instantly run the cmdlet as a background job. Each job runs a cmdlet in the background without interacting with the current session. This gives us the ability to perform an action on many targets quicker. This also come with some ‚Äúdownsides‚Äù, it‚Äôs resource consuming (depend on how many tasks running in the background) as each job is a separated process.</description>

      <title>Running Powershell Core in a Container</title>

      <guid>//localhost:8080/posts/running-powershell-core-in-a-container/</guid>
      <description>With Powershell V7 on the verge, the importance of building solutions that are cross-platforms in Powershell is bigger. One of the issues we have while running tests, is that our Powershell environment is not ‚Äúclean‚Äù as in other computers. That‚Äôs where Powershell Core in a container gets in the picture.&#xA;We install a lot of modules, software and other things that our target audience or servers won‚Äôt share. Our solution could act differently in those environments.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Today I want to talk about GUI for PowerShell. You probably wonder why? PowerShell is all about the CLI and moving away from the GUI. but sometimes, a GUI for our scripts can be very useful.&#xA;Every Company has HelpDesk team, other System Admins that don‚Äôt know PowerShell at all, or non-technical staff. While I will encourage them to learn, I can‚Äôt make them. As a result, I need to provide them with a GUI for some of the tools or solutions.</description>

      <description>Konichiwa Yujin,&#xA;Sorry for not posting for so long, I been to Japan for a work trip. While Japan is amazing, the state of the ESXi in the office wasn‚Äôt so great. The ESXi crushed, and after investigation, we notice that he had no free space on HDD‚Äôs, which was weird. we have 100TB, and only 4 VM‚Äôs. the first suspect? Snapshots!&#xA;Japanese Garden building&#xA;Snapshots are great, but they can be your worst enemy if you don‚Äôt use them correctly.</description>

      <description>I had a free day yesterday, and I always love to spend my free time on the Xbox or PlayStation, depends on the mood. So, while I‚Äôm rushing and jumping all over Australia with my Lamborghini, I got a phone call, my first instinct was to mute it and continue with my race, but it was a good friend&amp;hellip; so I muted it anyway üò∂. When I finished the race, I called him back (yes, I‚Äôm a good friendüòú).</description>

      <title>Update Powershell Help Background</title>

      <description>The help system in PowerShell is great. I think it&amp;rsquo;s the first thing everyone should master before they jump into PowerShell. By default, PowerShell ships without the help files, so first you have to update the PowerShell help database to unlock its power. Over the time, you will collect more modules and updates, so keeping it up to date is a challenge.&#xA;Image PowerShell terminal running Get-Help&#xA;When you run PowerShell in a new computer, and try to use the Get-Help cmdlet, PowerShell will ask you if you want to update help first, if you choose not to, the help you will get will be very limited.</description>

      <description>When I started to learn PowerShell, I said to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do everything in PowerShell‚Äù. In the beginning, the simpler stuff like unlocking a locked-out account, or resetting a password, took me 5 minutes. I had to google how to do it on PowerShell, understand what I‚Äôm reading and testing it before I‚Äôm deleting all organization users.&#xA;With the practice and learning, things become much better and most important, faster.</description>

      <description>I had a conversation with a friend today, talked about work, he told me that he has some scripts that he uses a lot in his day-to-day job, and thought about creating a script that loads all of them at once. The first thing I told him is ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you set up a profile?‚Äù he waited for a few seconds and told me that he doesn‚Äôt know about profiles. If you are reading this and feel the same, this post is for you üôÇ PowerShell profile is a script that runs every time we start the shell.</description>

      <description>Namaste! I‚Äôm sitting in my hotel room, it‚Äôs very late, hoping not to get sick. It‚Äôs my first day in India, as my company has an office here in New Delhi. If you wonder why I hope not to get sick, well, this was my dinner today:&#xA;Image of my indian dinner&#xA;To be honest, it was very nice, not the best I had, but far from my worst one. If you didn‚Äôt notice, it had chicken inside.</description>
