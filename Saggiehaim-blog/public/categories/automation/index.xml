      <description>With Powershell V7 on the verge, the importance of building solutions that are cross-platforms in Powershell is bigger. One of the issues we have while running tests, is that our Powershell environment is not “clean” as in other computers. That’s where Powershell Core in a container gets in the picture.&#xA;We install a lot of modules, software and other things that our target audience or servers won’t share. Our solution could act differently in those environments.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Today I want to talk about GUI for PowerShell. You probably wonder why? PowerShell is all about the CLI and moving away from the GUI. but sometimes, a GUI for our scripts can be very useful.&#xA;Every Company has HelpDesk team, other System Admins that don’t know PowerShell at all, or non-technical staff. While I will encourage them to learn, I can’t make them. As a result, I need to provide them with a GUI for some of the tools or solutions.</description>
